# How do you find the shortest path between two points? Breadth-first search.
# Breadth first search determines whether there is a path from A to B and
# what is the shortest path from A to B.

# Translate your data into a graph.
# Graphs are made of items called nodes and links between nodes are edges.
# Nodes are represented as circles and edges as arrows (or lines).

# Directed graphs use arrows for edges.
# An arrow starting at node Sunny Jim and ending at node Dougie Jones means
# SJ has a direct relationship to DJ. Sunny is linked to the family through Dougie.

# An Undirected graph uses lines for edges.
# A line means the relationship goes both ways.
# A line starting at node Nomi and ending at node Amanita means
# Nomanita is an iconic tv love and also 
# Nomi is married to Amanitia and Aminita is married to Nomi.

# Once you have a graph how do you navigate it?
# Use a queue structure. A queue is a collection of elements accessed by FIFO.
